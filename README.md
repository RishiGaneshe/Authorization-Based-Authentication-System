# 🚀 Authorization-Based Authentication System  

A **secure and scalable authentication system** implementing **role-based authorization**, **JWT authentication**, and **Redis-based token blacklisting**. Designed for **production-grade applications**, this system ensures **data consistency**, **security**, and **atomic operations** with **database transactions**.  

## 🔥 Features  

✅ **Role-Based Authentication** – Assign and validate user roles for access control.  
✅ **JWT Authentication** – Secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens.  
✅ **Redis Token Blacklisting** – Secure session management and logout handling.  
✅ **SendGrid Email OTP Verification** – Secure user registration with email-based OTP.  
✅ **Password Hashing** – Strong password security using **Argon2 / Bcrypt**.  
✅ **Database Transactions & Atomicity** – Prevents partial updates and ensures consistency.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

- **Node.js & Express.js** – Backend framework  
- **MongoDB Atlas** – Cloud database (⚠️ *Required for transaction support*)  
- **Mongoose** – ODM for MongoDB  
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** – Secure authentication  
- **Redis** – Token blacklisting for session management  
- **SendGrid** – Email OTP verification  
- **Argon2 / Bcrypt** – Password hashing for security

## ⚠️ Caution  

🔴 **MongoDB Atlas is required for transactions!**  
Local MongoDB does **not** support transactions due to the lack of **replica set initialization**, which is essential for **atomicity and consistency** in database operations.

## 📌 Why Use This Authentication System?  

✔️ **Security-First Approach** – Implements best practices for authentication & authorization.  
✔️ **Scalable & Maintainable** – Designed for real-world applications with high user loads.  
✔️ **Database Integrity with Transactions** – Ensures **atomicity**, so either all steps complete or none do.  
✔️ **Session Management** – Token blacklisting prevents **replay attacks** and **unauthorized access**.  
✔️ **Reliable OTP Verification** – Ensures valid user registrations with email verification.

## 📌 How Transactions Ensure Data Integrity  

This system uses **MongoDB transactions** to ensure **atomic operations** when:  
- **Creating a new user** – The user profile is saved **only if OTP verification succeeds**.  
- **Updating user roles** – Ensures **role updates** are committed only if all conditions are met.  
- **Revoking JWT tokens** – The token is **blacklisted only if** session revocation succeeds.  

By using transactions, we prevent **partial updates**, maintaining **data consistency** across the database.
